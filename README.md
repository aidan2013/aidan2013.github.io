# UFOs

## Overview of the Project:

The purpose of this project is to creata a webpage with a dynamic table that allows users to filter and analyze UFO sightings data based on user defined criteria such as date, city, state, country and shape. 


## Results:

The webpage will default to display a table with the entire dataset. 
The data can be filtered by the entering one or more of the following criteria: Date, City, State, Country, Shape

- In order to filter the date, the user will enter the desired criteria into the designated input box. 
- It is important to note that the filter search is case sensitive.

- The table will update once the user presses **"Enter"**.

## Summary:

One of the drawbacks of this design is the filter search has to match exactly to the value in the table otherwise it will not return a result. 
Two enhancements would be to update the code to allow for the filter table to not be case sensitive. Another enhancement would be to add a keyword search that would bring in sightings that met the keyword search anywhere within the table.
